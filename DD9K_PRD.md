# **Product Requirements Document: DeejDrone 9000**

## Version 0.1 | Enterprise Aviation Division | 20250819

## **\[EXS\] Executive Summary**

The DeejDrone 9000 represents our company's strategic expansion from autonomous ground vehicles into the rapidly growing enterprise drone market. Leveraging our proven expertise in autonomous navigation systems and our commitment to sustainable transportation, we are uniquely positioned to revolutionize aerial cargo delivery with the world's first biodiesel-powered enterprise quadcopter.

Our extensive customer relationships in logistics and supply chain management provide an immediate pathway to market adoption, as 87% of our current autonomous truck customers have expressed interest in integrated air-ground delivery solutions (based on informal conversations at our last customer summit).

## **\[PV\] Purpose and Vision**

### **\[PV-01\] Strategic Purpose**

The DeejDrone 9000 addresses critical gaps in remote logistics delivery where traditional ground transportation faces insurmountable challenges: mountainous terrain, island deliveries, disaster zones, and time-critical transport of sensitive materials. Our biodiesel propulsion system uniquely solves the range anxiety and environmental concerns that plague current battery-electric solutions.

### **\[PV-02\] Problem Statement**

Enterprise logistics operators currently face a trilemma: speed (helicopters), sustainability (electric drones), or range (fixed-wing aircraft). No existing solution delivers all three. The DeejDrone 9000's biodiesel architecture enables 350-mile range at 85mph while maintaining carbon-negative operations.
