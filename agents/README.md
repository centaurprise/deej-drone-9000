# **Agent system instruction templates**

## 

## How to use: 
Set the full `Agent` code block as the definition for an OpenAI or gtp-oss agent, or use just the system instructions (after `instructions`) as inputs for your agent of choice. 
These tasks are reasonably well-defined, so mini models _should_ do pretty well.
You may want to test bigger models first and work your way down, especially if your product gaps, customers, and/or customer data are particularly non-standard or scattered across sources / formats / products. 
The more work the model needs to do, the worse a little model is going to perform, and the more value youâ€™ll get from pre-work cleaning up the feed you send it.
